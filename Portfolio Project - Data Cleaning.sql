-- 1. Remove Duplicates

# First let's check for duplicates



SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging
;


SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		layoffs_staging
) duplicates;



ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging ADD row_num INT;


SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging
;

CREATE TABLE `layoffs_staging2` (
`company` text,
`location`text,
`industry`text,
`total_laid_off` INT,
`percentage_laid_off` text,
`date` text,
`stage`text,
`country` text,
`funds_raised_millions` int,
row_num INT
);

INSERT INTO `layoffs_staging2`

`date`,
`stage`,
`country`,

`row_num`)
SELECT `company`,

			PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
			) AS row_num
	FROM

-- now that we have this we can delete rows were row_num is greater than 2

DELETE FROM layoffs_staging2

-- 2. Standardize Data------;

SELECT * 
FROM layoffs_staging2;

SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- let's take a look at these
SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'Bally%';
-- nothing wrong here
SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'airbnb%';


UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = '';

-- now if we check those are all null

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- now we need to populate those nulls if possible

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
WHERE t1.industry IS NULL
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- ---------------------------------------------------

-- I also noticed the Crypto has multiple different variations. We need to standardize that - let's say all to Crypto
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry IN ('Crypto Currency', 'CryptoCurrency');

-- now that's taken care of:
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

-- --------------------------------------------------
-- we also need to look at 

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2;

-- everything looks good except apparently we have some "United States" and some "United States." with a period at the end. Let's standardize this.
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country);

-- now if we run this again it is fixed
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;


-- Let's also fix the date columns:
SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2;

-- we can use str to date to update this field
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

-- now we can convert the data type properly
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;


SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2;




-- 4. remove any columns and rows we need to

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL;


SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

-- Delete Useless data we can't really use
DELETE FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT * 
FROM layoffs_staging2;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;


SELECT * 
FROM layoffs_staging2;
